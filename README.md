# Lairetam Theme for Omarchy

Inspired by Google's Material Design 2 color system and made for Omarchy - the opinionated Arch-based Linux distribution made for pioneers.

I created this theme because Material Design 2's color palette excels where it matters most: extended coding sessions, terminal work, and complex technical tasks. The colors are easy on the eyes while providing excellent syntax highlighting and visual hierarchy.
